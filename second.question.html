            What distinguishes normal HTML elements from semantic HTML elements? </h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Normal HTML Elements:
                    These are generic elements used to structure a webpage without conveying any specific meaning about their content.<br/>
                    They are typically used for layout and styling purposes, and while they provide structure,
                     they don't convey any additional information about the content they contain.<br/>
                    They rely heavily on classes and IDs for styling and scripting.eg 'div>, 'span>,  'i>,  'b> etc </li>

                    <h5>while</h5>

                    <li>Semantic HTML Elements:
                        Semantic HTML elements, on the other hand, convey meaning about the content they contain.<br/>
They describe the purpose of the element and the type of content it contains, <br/>
making the HTML more meaningful and understandable both to developers and to assistive technologies like screen readers.'header>, 'footer>,
    'article>,'section>,'nav>,aside> etc
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       On the other hand Semantic HTML element 
                     are self-explanatory and indicate the role of the content to both humans and search engines.<br/>
                     They improve accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO) because search engines can better understand the structure and meaning of the content.
                    </li>
                </ol>

<h1><i>question No.3b</i><br/>
    Explain the disparity between closing tags and self-closing tags in HTML.</h1>
    <li>Closing Tags:<br/>
     These tags have an opening tag and a corresponding closing tag. <br/>
     The content between the opening and closing tags defines the element<br/>
     
        <li>Self-closing Tags: <br/>
            These tags don't require a separate closing tag because they don't contain any content or they are standalone. Instead, they have a forward slash before the closing angle bracket in the opening tag.<br/>
             For example:<img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">
             Here, <img> is a self-closing tag. It doesn't have a separate closing tag because it doesn't contain any content.<br/>
              It simply inserts an image into the document. The attributes src and alt provide additional information about the image.</li><br/>
              <div>furthermore,
                The disparity between closing tags and self-closing tags mainly arises from the necessity to distinguish between elements that contain content and those that don't.<br/>
                 Closing tags are used for elements that wrap around content, while self-closing tags are used for elements that stand alone or don't contain content themselves.<br/>
                 This differentiation helps maintain the structure and readability of HTML documents.</div>
              
             </ol>.
              
            <h1><i>question no.3c</i><br/>
                What distinguishes inline elements from block elements in HTML?
            </h1>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Block Elements:

Block-level elements typically start on a new line and occupy the full width available to them within their containing element.<br/>
They create a "block" of content, causing subsequent elements to appear below them.<br/>
Common block-level elements include div>, p>, h1> to h6>, ul>, ol>, li>, table>, form>, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inline Elements:

Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.<br/>
They flow within the content of a block-level element and do not force a new line to start.<br/>
Inline elements can appear beside each other horizontally.<br/>
Examples of inline elements include 'span>, 'a>, 'strong>, 'em>, 'img>, 'input>, 'button>, etc.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The distinction between block and inline elements is crucial for understanding how HTML elements interact with each other and<br/>
                 how they affect the layout and structure of a web page.<br/>
                 It influences styling, positioning, and the overall visual presentation of content.
